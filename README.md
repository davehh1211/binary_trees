## Learning Objectives:bulb:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
* What you should learn from this project:

## Prerequisites

For further installation is necessary to set this program on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Vagrant in VirtualBox.

You need to install this software

1. VirtualBox - Virtual Machine
2. Vagrant
3. Emacs
4. Vim/Vi

6. Usage: monty file


## Environment

This project was constructed and tested in the previous set up and debugged with GCC version 4.8.4.


## Instalation.
Follow the following instructions to get a copy of the program and run in your local machine.

- Clone the following repository.
 > `https://github.com/davehh1211/binary_trees

- Compile it with GCC
 > `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -g -o executable_name`

- Run the program
 > `./executable_name`

 - Run with debugger
 > `valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./executable_name`


## Built with...

- Visual Studio Code - Coding and structuring.
